# DocReview360 Release Checklist (Open Items Only)

This file tracks unfinished work only.

Completed work moved to:

- `docs/latest_features.md`
- `docs/release-completed-items.md`

Target window: next month (confirm exact date and time zone).

## Release blockers and execution

### Auth and security gaps

- [ ] Full Keycloak integration (JWKS validation, claim-to-role mapping).

### 13) Scope and release targets

- [ ] Define supported platforms and document them.
- [ ] Freeze feature scope. Fixes only after this checkpoint.
- [ ] Create a release branch and protect `main`.

### 14) Repository hygiene and public readiness

- [ ] Run a secret scan on the full history and working tree.
- [ ] Remove or rotate any hardcoded tokens, test credentials, or sample secrets.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary files and stale artifacts before release.
- [ ] Ensure all `example.com` and placeholder URLs or emails are updated.
- [ ] Confirm the `SECURITY.md` contact email is real and monitored.

### 15) Packaging and versioning

- [ ] Decide and document the versioning scheme in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Test install from the built artifacts in a clean environment.
- [ ] If publishing, perform a TestPyPI dry run.
- [ ] Decide whether frontend assets are part of the PyPI package and document the answer.

### 15a) Publish payload and exclusion rules

**PyPI wheel and sdist must include only release artifacts**

- [ ] Ship only runtime Python package contents needed by installs:
  `src/docreview360/**`, required templates, migrations, runtime JSON or schema files,
  `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and package metadata.
- [ ] Exclude `tests/` from the published sdist. The current `dist/docreview360-0.1.2.tar.gz`
  still includes the full test tree.
- [ ] Review `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` and replace the broad wildcard rule with an
  explicit allowlist of runtime assets.
- [ ] Verify the wheel does not ship runtime-generated state or logs.
- [ ] Regenerate the wheel and sdist and inspect the file lists before publish.

**Docker image and build context must exclude local junk**

- [ ] Stop the Docker build from copying unnecessary repo content after dependency install,
  or verify `.dockerignore` fully protects the build context.

**Repository ignore list should be tightened before public release**

- [ ] Decide whether `frontend/document_types.json`, `frontend/phases.json`, and
  `frontend/phase_workflow_links.json` are still needed. Remove or ignore them if not.
  (Added to `.gitignore`, but the three files are still tracked in git as of 2026-03-10.)
- [ ] Remove or ignore `frontend/pages__backup_js_*` before release.
  (Added to `.gitignore`, but the backup trees are still tracked in git as of 2026-03-10.)

**Public GitHub repository readiness**

- [ ] Remove local or internal-only root files before making the repo public, or move them
  out of the default branch: `_debug_test.py`, `ai-notes.md`, `push-after-fix.ps1`,
  `tatus`, local DB files, and ad hoc runtime JSON stores.
- [ ] Review `.dev/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_UPDATES.md` and decide
  whether they belong in the public repository.
- [ ] Replace public-facing placeholders and stale metadata:
  `info@example.com`, `example.com` URLs, `registry.example.com`, and stale GPL references.
- [ ] Update docs and metadata that still mention GPL or placeholder contact data.
- [ ] Review references to private repositories and remove or clearly mark them as optional.
- [ ] Confirm branch protection, issue tracker settings, security reporting, and Actions
  settings are ready for a public repository.

### 16) Documentation and user experience

- [ ] Audit docs in `docs/` for broken links and outdated instructions.
- [ ] Ensure `README.md` matches `.dev/AGENTS.md` structure requirements.
- [ ] Add or verify a Quick Start that works on Windows and macOS/Linux.
- [ ] Publish `docs/adr/0001-core-architecture.md` and verify accuracy.
- [ ] Generate FastAPI API docs and link them from the README.
- [ ] If using MkDocs, run `mkdocs build --strict` and fix errors.

### 17) Backend quality gates

- [ ] Run `pytest -q`.
- [ ] Run `pytest -q --cov=src --cov-branch --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=90`.
- [ ] Run `mypy --strict src tests` if type coverage is ready.
- [ ] Run `mutmut run`.
- [ ] Run `trivy fs .`.

### 18) Frontend-backend integration

- [ ] Run E2E smoke.
- [ ] Run E2E full.
- [ ] Manually verify the full flow on a clean environment.
- [ ] Verify login works as admin (`alice`) and non-admin (`bob`).
- [ ] Verify project creation persists after refresh.
- [ ] Verify document upload, view, and edit from the UI.
- [ ] Verify approval request flow updates status in the UI.
- [ ] Verify PDF and Markdown export from UI or CLI.
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` against the deployed backend URL.
- [ ] Verify CORS allows the frontend origin.
- [ ] Verify UI error handling when the backend is unavailable.

### 19) CI/CD and automation

- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions CI passes on a clean run.
- [ ] Ensure the CI coverage threshold matches the release gate.
- [ ] Decide whether to automate PyPI publish on tag.

### 19a) AI-assisted automation candidates

- [ ] Evaluate `karpathy/autoresearch` as a pattern source, not a drop-in dependency. Use it only if each loop has a single target metric, a fixed run budget, and an objective pass or fail gate.
- [ ] Keep AI automation scoped to repository quality work. Ignore GitHub release publishing, PyPI publishing, Docker push, and other external release side effects unless a human explicitly enables them.
- [ ] Add a local "release shepherd" loop that reads `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, picks 1 unchecked item, attempts a minimal change, runs only the required checks, and writes a short outcome report.
- [ ] Require artifact-based state for every autonomous run: prompt text, selected files, commands run, exit codes, test results, diff summary, and stop reason under `artifacts/automation/`.
- [ ] Define hard AI guardrails before any autonomous loop: approved model list, max turns, max tokens, retry limit, fallback model, writable path allowlist, and mandatory human review for high-risk files.
- [ ] Add a lockfile or lease so only 1 automation loop edits the repo at a time.
- [ ] Add a watchdog that stops the loop after repeated no-op diffs, repeated failing tests, or budget exhaustion.
- [ ] Prototype a Raspberry Pi-friendly runner for headless loops with a shell wrapper, lockfile, and append-only logs instead of relying on `cron` or `systemd`.
- [ ] Add custom Claude Code commands for repeatable maintenance tasks such as `/triage-failure`, `/docs-drift`, `/packaging-audit`, `/release-shepherd`, and `/checklist-next`.
- [ ] Use Claude Code hooks to enforce "read tests first" and "run verification before write" for autonomous maintenance commands.
- [ ] Build a failing-test triage loop that watches `pytest`, Playwright, and E2E failures, clusters similar stack traces, drafts the likely root cause, and proposes the smallest patch.
- [ ] Build a flaky-test hunter that reruns smoke tests multiple times, captures artifacts, and ranks failures by frequency and first bad commit if git history is available.
- [ ] Build a docs drift checker that compares `README.md`, `docs/`, `pyproject.toml`, env var docs, Docker docs, and frontend scripts for mismatched commands, versions, and URLs.
- [ ] Build a packaging auditor that inspects wheel, sdist, and Docker contents and flags shipped tests, placeholders, internal files, or runtime junk before release.
- [ ] Build a placeholder and metadata reviewer that finds `example.com`, `info@example.com`, stale license text, inconsistent versions, and public repo readiness gaps.
- [ ] Build a dependency-review loop that summarizes `pip-audit`, `semgrep`, `bandit`, `trivy`, and `npm audit` output into actionable issues instead of raw scanner logs.
- [ ] Build a security-defaults reviewer focused on auth, OIDC, Keycloak, secrets, token lifetimes, and production-safe env defaults.
- [ ] Build a deployment drift checker that compares `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml`, Helm, Kubernetes manifests, and `docs/deployment.md` for inconsistent ports, env vars, health checks, and image tags.
- [ ] Build a performance regression loop that reruns `scripts/measure_performance_baseline.py`, compares results to `docs/performance_baseline.md`, and opens a focused fix task when thresholds regress.
- [ ] Build an accessibility loop for the Next.js frontend that runs axe or Playwright-based checks, captures screenshots, and drafts small UI fixes for obvious regressions.
- [ ] Build a UX smoke-review loop that logs in as `alice` and `bob`, exercises document upload and approval flows, then summarizes friction, broken states, and missing error messages.
- [ ] Build an audit-log integrity loop that verifies append-only behavior, hash-chain validation, retention settings, and backup restore steps after risky backend changes.
- [ ] Build an ML packaging verifier that compares PyTorch and ONNX outputs on a fixed fixture set, validates model metadata, and blocks model packaging when drift exceeds the threshold.
- [ ] Build a release-note drafter that reads merged commits, checklist changes, and user-visible diffs, then prepares a draft changelog for human review only.
- [ ] Build an issue-grooming loop that turns repeated failures or review findings into deduplicated GitHub issues with severity, repro steps, and file references.
- [ ] If `autoresearch` is trialed, start with read-only or report-only tasks first. Do not let it write code until its summaries are consistently useful on this repo.
- [ ] If `autoresearch` is trialed, restrict it to narrow surfaces such as docs drift, packaging review, flaky test analysis, or performance triage before attempting broader "improve the app" loops.

### 20) Security and compliance

- [ ] Review `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` and close or document open items.
- [ ] Validate that security checks mentioned in `SECURITY.md` actually run.
- [ ] Confirm password policy, secrets management, and encryption-at-rest docs are accurate.
- [ ] Verify OAuth/OIDC defaults and token lifetimes are reasonable for public use.
- [ ] Ensure audit log integrity checks are enabled and documented.

### 21) Infrastructure and deployment readiness

- [ ] Verify Docker build works end to end.
- [ ] Validate `docker-compose.yml` brings up all dependencies.
- [ ] Confirm `docs/deployment.md` matches current env vars and services.
- [ ] Validate `settings.yaml` defaults are safe for production.

### 22) Code review and fix-it loop

- [ ] Run targeted code review for backend.
- [ ] Run targeted code review for frontend.
- [ ] Run targeted code review for CLI and scripts.
- [ ] Document prompt intent and expected behavior before optimization changes.
- [ ] For each optimization change, run targeted tests first, then rerun unit and impacted E2E tests.
- [ ] For each review, open issues, fix them, and rerun the relevant tests.
- [ ] Ensure risky changes are covered by tests.

### 23) Release execution

- [ ] Bump version in `pyproject.toml` and align frontend versioning if needed.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes and date.
- [ ] Tag the release in git.
- [ ] Create the GitHub release with notes, assets, and checksums.
- [ ] Publish to PyPI after TestPyPI verification, if chosen.
- [ ] Publish the Docker image, if chosen, and verify tags.
- [ ] Announce the release with upgrade notes and known issues.

### 24) Post-release verification

- [ ] Install from PyPI into a fresh venv and run `docreview360 --help`.
- [ ] Smoke test the CLI to API to UI flow using released artifacts.
- [ ] Verify docs site or README links resolve correctly.
- [ ] Monitor issues and security reports for the first week.

### 43) 2026-03-10 review addendum

**43c) Duplicate API registration remains**

- [ ] Keep the router-based implementation or the legacy monolith, but not both.

**43d) Frontend API migration is incomplete**

- [ ] Broaden the frontend raw-fetch guard so it catches `fetch(`${API}/...`)`.
  (Remaining: pages with `authenticatedFetch(\`${API}/...\`)` work correctly but could use relative paths.)

## Product and architecture backlog

### 30) Large modules needing decomposition

- [ ] Decompose remaining large modules: `auth.py`, `search.py`, `workflows.py`, `doc_types.py`, `documents.py` (lower priority, defer to post-v0.2).

### 34) Federal Style Validator integration

**Architecture decision (2026-03-10):** Federal Style Validator (FSV) is a separate,
dedicated application that will be published as its own MIT-licensed package on PyPI
(and other registries). DocReview360 is an integration host — it must not duplicate
FSV's style, readability, quality, or regulatory logic internally.

**Integration contract:**

```
FSV (separate MIT package on PyPI, authoritative for all style/quality work)
  └── exposes: /validate, /quality, /readability, /regulatory-check (TBD by FSV)

DocReview360 backend
  └── thin proxy endpoints that forward to FSV and cache results in DB
  └── config: FEDERAL_STYLE_VALIDATOR_URL (base URL of running FSV instance)

DocReview360 editor integrations
  └── TipTap: FSV-provided TipTap plugin/extension (client to FSV's API)
  └── Other authoring tools: FSV-provided plugins (future)
```

**Internal implementations to remove once FSV integration is complete:**

- `tiptapFederalStyleLint.ts` — local regex/rule validation; replace with FSV's TipTap plugin
- `regulatory.py` — pattern-matching reimplementation; replace with proxy to FSV
- `ml/onnx_infer.py` quality scoring — replace with FSV quality output (keep model infra if FSV uses it)
- Inline preflight style checks in `checker.tsx` — replace with FSV API calls
- Local readability/plain-language scoring — FSV is authoritative for this

**What DocReview360 keeps:**

- Integration layer (proxy endpoints calling FSV, returning results to the UI)
- Result persistence (cache FSV scores in DB for history, sparklines, KPI cards)
- UI rendering of FSV output (decorations in TipTap, result cards, quality score table)
- Access control (authenticated users only for FSV calls)

**Phase 1 — Integration layer (prerequisite: FSV API contract defined)**

- [ ] Add `FEDERAL_STYLE_VALIDATOR_URL` config setting and document it.
- [ ] Replace `POST /documents/preflight` style checks with proxy call to FSV.
- [ ] Replace `POST /ai/regulatory-check` with proxy call to FSV regulatory endpoint.
- [ ] Replace `POST /ml/quality` scoring with proxy call to FSV quality endpoint.
- [ ] Remove `regulatory.py` duplicate pattern matching once FSV proxy is live.

**Phase 2 — Editor integration (prerequisite: FSV TipTap plugin exists)**

- [ ] Register FSV's TipTap plugin in `frontend/extensions/registry.ts`.
- [ ] Remove `tiptapFederalStyleLint.ts` (local reimplementation) once FSV plugin is wired in.
- [ ] Add sidebar panel showing live FSV validation summary and overall score.
- [ ] Configure FSV endpoint URL in the editor plugin via DocReview360's settings API.

**Phase 3 — Full cutover and documentation**

- [ ] Confirm no remaining duplicate style/quality logic in DocReview360 source.
- [ ] Document integration points, config, and FSV version requirements in `docs/federal-style-validator.md`.
- [ ] Add FSV as an optional dependency in `pyproject.toml` with install instructions.
- [ ] Define FSV version pinning and compatibility policy.

### 35) AI quality scores in project view

**Note:** Once FSV integration (item 34) is complete, quality scores must come from FSV,
not from internal scoring. The persistence and UI work below remains valid regardless of
the score source.

- [ ] Add `last_quality_score`, `last_quality_date`, and `plain_language_grade` persistence.
- [ ] Compute and store scores on document changes or preflight runs (via FSV proxy once available).
- [ ] Add score history sparkline or trend indicator per document.
- [ ] Include quality score summary in dashboard KPI cards.

### 40) Compliance, records management, and accessibility

- [ ] Add long-term digital signature compliance support.

### 41) Editor, integrations, and content management

**Phase 1 — Enterprise content integrations**

- [ ] Add Microsoft 365 co-authoring via WOPI.

**Phase 2 — Editor hardening**

- [ ] Add offline editing support.
- [ ] Expand import and export format fidelity.

**Phase 3 — Enterprise search and analytics**

- [ ] Add OpenSearch or Elasticsearch-backed full-text search.
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard and exportable reports.

### 42) Configuration and extensibility

- [ ] Add theme and white-label support.
